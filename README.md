# JupyterCanvasSubmit
### Jupyter/Canvas submission framework integration

Cloud-based JupyterHub installations allow computing students to learn
in an easy-to-access online environment with a literate coding style in
Jupyter Notebooks. We outline an interface and technical design proposal
for a system that makes integrating JupyterHub with Canvas straightforward
and invited discussion and feedback.
